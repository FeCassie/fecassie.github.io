I've worked on various incident response, threat research and threat hunting teams throughout my career with over seven years.

Currently I'm working as a **Blue Team Engineer** at **[Picus Security](https://www.picussecurity.com/)** focused on Security R&D.
I've also participated in various cyber security organizations as a speaker and instructor.

I've focused mostly on defensive security mechanisms and developing security tools.
In my free time, I like doing security research and I write on this blog about the topics I've researched.
