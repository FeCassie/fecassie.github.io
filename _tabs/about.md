I've worked on various digital forensics incident response, threat research and threat hunting teams throughout my career.

Currently I'm working as a **Senior Security Engineer, Blue Team** at **[Picus Security](https://www.picussecurity.com/)** focused on Security R&D. I've focused mostly on defensive security mechanisms and developing security tools.
I've also participated in various cyber security organizations as a speaker and instructor.
