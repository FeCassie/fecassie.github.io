I have over seven years of experience in the cybersecurity field, with a strong focus on defensive security. 
Throughout my career, I have played a key role in incident response, threat research, and threat hunting teams, consistently contributing to strengthening organizational security postures.

Currently, I've been working as **Expert Cyber Security Engineer** at **[Turkish Airlines Technology](https://turkishtechnology.com/)**, specializing in endpoint security, detection engineering, dfir, and R&D.

Beyond my professional role, I am deeply interested in security research, particularly in macOS security. 
As an active member of the cybersecurity community, I have also delivered talks at prominent cybersecurity conferences, including BSides Prishtina, The H@CK Summit, Hacktrick, and DevFest Istanbul.
